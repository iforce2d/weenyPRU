# PCB assembly files (JLCPCB)

The files in this folder are intended to be used for ordering boards from a fabricator. Some items have been removed to avoid warnings when uploading them to JLCPCB and make the process smoother for newcomers. As such, they do NOT contain all items necessary for DIY pick and place setup, eg. fiducials.

If you're assembling your own boards, open the project from the oshwlab links in the parent folder and export the BOM and PickAndPlace from the File menu, to get a full listing of items.

If you are a newbie at ordering PCB assembly, see this video for an example of using the files above (the board in the video is different but the procedure is the same): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKhxOeRhcWc
